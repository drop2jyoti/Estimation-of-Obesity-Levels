##Estimation of Obesity Levels Based on Eating Habits and Physical Condition Using Data Analysis

#Project Overview

Our aim in this project is to create a model based on physical characteristics (such as age, gender, height and weight) and lifestyle habits (e.g. eating patterns, exercise, 
smoking, and water intake) that can help predict obesity levels. To do so we analyze the dataset titled  "Estimation of Obesity Levels Based On Eating Habits and Physical Condition”.   


Potential Uses and Applications

For Public Health Officials: By determining which features in the dataset are the greatest predictors of obesity levels, public health professionals could craft educational campaigns focusing on the most impactful aspects. This would provide insight into what individuals should focus on to reduce their risk of obesity.  
For Medical Professional:  The results could be used by health care professionals to monitor and manage obesity. More specifically it could be applied to help create a health recommendation system by leveraging the identified key variables related to lifestyle habits, dietary patterns, and physical conditions.  Such a system could  aid in identifying at risk individuals who could  then be offered interventions and support.  

Analysis Goals

Leveraging Feature Importance for Public Awareness on Key Factors to Combat Obesity : To create public awareness and highlight the key factors influencing obesity, we can use feature importance analysis. 
Analyzing the Impact of Family History and Habits: This dataset includes features such as family history of overweight and consumption patterns, which could be analyzed to study their impact on 
Predicting user engagement with technological devices:  Technology usage(e.g. smartphone, TV, videogames, computers and other digital tools) correlates with obesity across various age group. 


Dataset

The dataset "Estimation of Obesity Levels Based On Eating Habits and Physical Condition “ contains 16 features and 2111 observations. The dataset contains information on individuals from Peru, Mexico and Columbia.
The key variables (features) in this dataset, based on feature importance and relevance to the problem of obesity, are:

•	Gender

•	Age:  A person's age may affect their metabolic rate and lifestyle, influencing obesity levels.

•	Height: Useful for calculating Body Mass Index (BMI), which is closely related to obesity.

•	Weight: One of the most critical variables for determining obesity.

•	Family History with Overweight: Whether a person has a genetic predisposition to being overweight or obese, which can significantly impact obesity risk.

•	Frequent Consumption of High-Calorie Food (FAVC): This reflects dietary habits, particularly the consumption of high-calorie foods, which is a known risk factor for obesity.

•	Frequency of Consumption of Vegetables (FCVC): A higher intake of vegetables is typically associated with a healthier diet and lower risk of obesity.

•	Number of Meals (NCP): The number of meals consumed daily can impact weight gain, especially if portion sizes are not controlled.

•	Consumption of Food Between Meals (CAEC): Eating snacks or meals outside of regular eating hours can contribute to weight gain.

•	Smoking Habit (SMOKE): Smoking status can influence metabolism and overall health, affecting obesity.

•	Water Intake (CH2O): Adequate water intake can aid in digestion and prevent overeating, indirectly influencing weight management.

•	Calories Consumed (CALC): Regular or frequent alcohol consumption adds extra calories, contributing to weight gain.

•	Physical Activity Frequency (FAF): Frequency of physical activity is a key factor in energy expenditure and weight control.

•	Time Spent Using Technology (TUE): Time spent on technology or screens is often linked to sedentary behavior, which can contribute to obesity.

•	Transportation Mode (MTRANS): The mode of transportation, such as walking or using public transportation, reflects levels of physical activity in daily life.

•	Outcome variable: categorized as Normal weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II and Obesity Type III.
